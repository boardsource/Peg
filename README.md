# Peg - KMK GUI Key Mapping Tool

Peg is an open-source KMK GUI Key Mapping Tool designed to make keyboard configuration easy and accessible. It empowers users to create and customize keymaps for their keyboards effortlessly.

## Technologies Used

Peg is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js 16:** The core of Peg is powered by Node.js 16, providing a robust backend for handling various tasks.

- **TypeScript:** The project is developed using TypeScript, offering type safety and improved code quality.

- **Solid.js:** Peg's user interface is built using Solid.js, a fast and efficient JavaScript library for creating web applications.

- **Electron:** Electron is utilized to create cross-platform desktop applications, making Peg accessible on various operating systems.

## Upcoming Features and Roadmap

We are committed to improving Peg and making it even more useful for our users. Here are some exciting upcoming features and our roadmap:

### 1. Browser-First Experience

We are actively working on transitioning Peg into a browser-first application. This will allow you to use Peg directly from your web browser, eliminating the need for installation and making it even more accessible.

### 2. COM Port for File Updates

We are exploring the integration of the COM Port library for handling file updates, moving away from direct file system manipulation. This will improve the reliability and safety of file operations within Peg.

### 3. JSON-Based Keymap Storage

One of our major enhancements in the pipeline is the migration of the entire keymap configuration to a JSON format. This will simplify keymap management and improve compatibility with various tools and platforms.

We are excited about these upcoming changes and the future of Peg. Stay tuned for updates as we continue to work on these features and enhance your keyboard mapping experience!
